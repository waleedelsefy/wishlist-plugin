## About plugin

The wishlist is one of the most powerful and popular tools in an ecommerce shop. Thanks to the wishlist, users can:

* Save their favourite products, find them quickly and easily at a later time and buy them.
* Share the wishlist with relatives and friends for Christmas, birthdays and similar occasions so they can buy them one of the products from the list.
* Share the wishlist on social networks and get indirect advertising for your store.

This means that you’ll be able to loyalise customers, push them to buy and attract new customers any time a wishlist is shared. Not bad for one plugin only, don’t you think?

Our AJ WooCommerce Wishlist has more than **800,000 active installations** and that’s why it’s **the most popular wishlist plugin ever.**

To celebrate this record and say thanks to all the plugin users, we’ve decided to release a new 3.0 version that has improved the design tremendously  and added many new options.
